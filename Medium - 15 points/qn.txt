We received an unofficial triage from our team, a guy who claims himself as “alien Hacker” is planning to attack our owasp srm server via some automated scripts. Well, he is a good programmer but not sure about hacking :)
We need two parameters from your OSINT master!

Qn 1- Which domain of our server is at risk?
Also, he thinks he is too smart, but never knows he is a script kiddie too, 

Qn 2- give his exposed identity leakage by decoding a few logics

Qn 3 - Can you find our what African country this car is frommmmmm??? --
